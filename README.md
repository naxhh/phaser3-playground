# Phaser 3 playground

This is a repo to experiment with Phaser 3.

Small demos, examples, tutorials and other strange stuff will be here.

### Run a game

Most of the games require a web-server. Unless they have a custom README explaining how to set up.
You need to use whatever web-server you wnat in the folder.

Currently i'm using `http-server`
```
npm install -g http-server
cd 01-first-game
http-server
```
